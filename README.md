This repository hosts the code for the project titled **"Real-Time Scream Detection and Position Estimation for Worker Safety in Construction Sites"**. The goal is to develop a system that leverages deep learning to detect screams and estimate positions for enhanced safety monitoring on construction sites, particularly in environments with limited resources.

## About the Project

This project combines deep learning-based scream detection and position estimation to identify worker distress in real-time, using microphones and minimal equipment. The system is tailored for low-resource construction environments to enhance worker safety through prompt alerts.

## Code Release

The code for both the scream detection and position estimation modules will be made available after our paper is accepted for publication. We will provide:

- A deep learning model for scream detection
- A position estimation algorithm designed for low-resource deployment

Stay tuned for updates on this repository!
